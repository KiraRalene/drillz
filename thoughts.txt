Here is a text file to record necessary changes to our implementation.

Roger:
  It makes very little sense to associate drills and solutions with their
  creators since any instructor should have the power to edit and delete. We
  ought to remove the user_id columns for both drills and solutions.

  Needed addition: implement another join table between users and drill_groups.
  It would keep track of how many times a user has finished a drill_group and
  the score for each attempt. When the student decides to reattempt the
  drill_group that they did not get a perfect score on, we can then use the
  attempts table to figure out which ones haven't been answered correctly.

  How should we implement a drill_group session?
  2 ways:
    Load all the drills in a drill_group into show page and have jquery handle
    next drill. The testing page will then be effectively a single page app.
    This is probably the easier way.

    Save each attempt of drill into database. We will either:
      Use a new table to store temporary attempts just for that quiz session or

      Change the current attempts table to just store attempts and correctness

  I would like to discuss these implementations
